Writer

Write out to a stream the following contents:

csv stream with data feeds, strategies, indicators and observers

Which objects actually go into the csv stream can be controlled with the

csv
 attribute of each object (defaults to True for 
data feeds
 and

observers
 / False for 
indicators
)

A summary of the properties of

Data Feeds

Strategies (lines and parameters)

Indicators/Observers: (lines and parameters)

Analyzers: (parameters and analysis outcome)

There is only a single Writer defined called 
WriterFile
, which can be added
to the system:

By setting the 
writer
 parameter of cerebro to True

A standard 
WriterFile
 will be instantiated

By calling 
Cerebro.addwriter(writerclass, **kwargs)

writerclass
 will be instantiated during backtesting execution with the
givenn 
kwargs

Given that a standard 
WriterFile
 does not ouput 
csv
 as a default,
the following 
addwriter
 invocation would take care of it:

```
cerebro.addwriter(bt.WriterFile, csv=True)

```

Reference

class backtrader.WriterFile()

The system wide writer class.

It can be parametrized with:

out
 (default: 
sys.stdout
): output stream to write to

If a string is passed a filename with the content of the parameter will
be used

close_out
  (default: 
False
)

If 
out
 is a stream whether it has to be explicitly closed by the
writer

csv
 (default: 
False
)

If a csv stream of the data feeds, strategies, observers and indicators
has to be written to the stream during execution

Which objects actually go into the csv stream can be controlled with
the 
csv
 attribute of each object (defaults to 
True
 for 
data
feeds
 and 
observers
 / False for 
indicators
)

csv_filternan
 (default: 
True
) whether 
nan
 values have to be
    purged out of the csv stream (replaced by an empty field)

csv_counter
 (default: 
True
) if the writer shall keep and print
    out a counter of the lines actually output

indent
 (default: 
2
) indentation spaces for each level

separators

seplen
 (default: 
79

Number of decimal places to round floats down to. With 
None
 no
rounding is performed
