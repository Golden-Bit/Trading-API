Introduction

Welcome to the 
backtrader
 documentation!

The platform has 2 main objectives:

Ease of use

Go back to 1

Note

Loosely based on the 
Karate (Kid)
 rules by 
Mr. Miyagi
.

The basics of running this platform:

Create a Strategy

Decide on potential adjustable parameters

Instantiate the Indicators you need in the Strategy

Write down the logic for entering/exiting the market

Tip

Or alternatively:

Prepare some indicators to work as 
long
/
short
 signals

And then

Create a 
Cerebro
 Engine

First: Inject the 
Strategy
 (or signal-based strategy)

And then:

Load and Inject a Data Feed (once created use 
cerebro.adddata
)

And execute 
cerebro.run()

For visual feedback use: 
cerebro.plot()

The platform is highly configurable

Letâ€™s hope you, the user, find the platform useful and fun to work with.
