Strategy

A 
Cerebro
 instance is the pumping heart and controlling brain of

backtrader
. A 
Strategy
 is the same for the platform user.

The 
Strategy’s
 expressed lifecycle in methods

Note

A strategy can be interrupted during 
birth
 by raising a

StrategySkipError
 exception from the module 
backtrader.errors

This will avoid going through the strategy during a backtesting. See
the section 
Exceptions

Conception: 
__init__

This is obviously invoked during instantiation: 
indicators
 will be
 created here and other needed attribute. Example:

```
def __init__(self):
    self.sma = btind.SimpleMovingAverage(period=15)

```

Birth: 
start

The world (
cerebro
) tells the strategy is time to start kicking. A
 default empty method exists.

Childhood: 
prenext

indicators
 declared during conception will have put constraints on how
 long the strategy needs to mature: this is called the 
minimum
 period
. Above 
__init__
 created a 
SimpleMovingAverage
 with a

period=15
.

As long as the system has seen less than 
15
 bars, 
prenext
 will be
 called (the default implementation is a no-op)

Adulthood: 
next

Once the system has seen 
15
 bars and the 
SimpleMovingAverage
 has a
 buffer large enough to start producing values, the strategy is mature
 enough to really execute.

There is a 
nextstart
 method which is called exactly 
once
, to mark
 the switch from 
prenext
 to 
next
. The default implementation of

nextstart
 is to simply call 
next

Reproduction: 
None

Ok, strategies do not really reproduce. But in a sense they do, because
 the system will instantiate them several times if 
optimizing
 (with
 different parameters)

Death: 
stop

The system tells the strategy the time to come to a reset and put things
 in order has come. A default empty method exists.

In most cases and for regular usage patterns this will look like:

```
class MyStrategy(bt.Strategy):

    def __init__(self):
        self.sma = btind.SimpleMovingAverage(period=15)

    def next(self):
        if self.sma > self.data.close:
            # Do something
            pass

        elif self.sma < self.data.close:
            # Do something else
            pass

```

In this snippet:

During 
__init__
 an attribute is assigned an indicator

The default empty 
start
 method is not overriden

prenext
 and 
nexstart
 are not overriden

In 
next
 the value of the indicator is compared against the closing
    price to do something

The default empty 
stop
 method is not overriden

Strategies, like a trader in the real world, will get notified when events take
place. Actually once per 
next
 cycle in the backtesting process. The
strategy will:

be notified through 
notify_order(order)
 of any status change in an
    order

be notified through 
notify_trade(trade)
 of any
    opening/updating/closing trade

be notified through 
notify_cashvalue(cash, value)
 of the current cash
    and portfolio in the broker

be notified through 
notify_fund(cash, value, fundvalue, shares)
 of the
    current cash and portfolio in the broker and tradking of fundvalue and
    shares

Events (implementation specific) via 
notify_store(msg, *args, **kwargs)

See Cerebro for an explanation on the 
store
 notifications. These
will delivered to the strategy even if they have also been delivered to a

cerebro
 instance (with an overriden 
notify_store
 method or via a

callback
)

And 
Strategies
 also like traders have the chance to operate in the market
during the 
next
 method to try to achieve profit with

the 
buy
 method to go long or reduce/close a short position

the 
sell
 method to go short or reduce/close a long position

the 
close
 method to obviously close an existing position

the 
cancel
 method to cancel a not yet executed order

How to Buy/Sell/Close

The 
Buy
 and 
Sell
 methods generate orders. When invoked they return an

Order
 (or subclass) instance that can be used as a reference. This order
has a unique 
ref
 identifier that can be used for comparison

Note

Subclasses of 
Order
 for speficic broker implementations may carry
additional 
unique identifiers
 provided by the broker.

To create the order use the following parameters:

data
 (default: 
None
)

For which data the order has to be created. If 
None
 then the
first data in the system, 
self.datas[0] or self.data0
 (aka

self.data
) will be used

size
 (default: 
None
)

Size to use (positive) of units of data to use for the order.

If 
None
 the 
sizer
 instance retrieved via 
getsizer
 will
be used to determine the size.

price
 (default: 
None
)

Price to use (live brokers may place restrictions on the actual
format if it does not comply to minimum tick size requirements)

None
 is valid for 
Market
 and 
Close
 orders (the market
determines the price)

For 
Limit
, 
Stop
 and 
StopLimit
 orders this value
determines the trigger point (in the case of 
Limit
 the trigger
is obviously at which price the order should be matched)

plimit
 (default: 
None
)

Only applicable to 
StopLimit
 orders. This is the price at which
to set the implicit 
Limit
 order, once the 
Stop
 has been
triggered (for which 
price
 has been used)

exectype
 (default: 
None
)

Possible values:

Order.Market
 or 
None
. A market order will be executed
  with the next available price. In backtesting it will be the
  opening price of the next bar

Order.Limit
. An order which can only be executed at the given

price
 or better

Order.Stop
. An order which is triggered at 
price
 and
  executed like an 
Order.Market
 order

Order.StopLimit
. An order which is triggered at 
price
 and
  executed as an implicit 
Limit
 order with price given by

pricelimit

valid
 (default: 
None
)

Possible values:

None
: this generates an order that will not expire (aka

Good til cancel
) and remain in the market until matched or
    canceled. In reality brokers tend to impose a temporal limit,
    but this is usually so far away in time to consider it as not
    expiring

datetime.datetime
 or 
datetime.date
 instance: the date
    will be used to generate an order valid until the given
    datetime (aka 
good til date
)

Order.DAY
 or 
0
 or 
timedelta()
: a day valid until
    the 
End of the Session
 (aka 
day
 order) will be generated

numeric value
: This is assumed to be a value corresponding
    to a datetime in 
matplotlib
 coding (the one used by

backtrader
) and will used to generate an order valid until
    that time (
good til date
)

tradeid
 (default: 
0
)

This is an internal value applied by 
backtrader
 to keep track
of overlapping trades on the same asset. This 
tradeid
 is sent
back to the 
strategy
 when notifying changes to the status of the
orders.

**kwargs
: additional broker implementations may support extra
    parameters. 
backtrader
 will pass the 
kwargs
 down to the
    created order objects

Example: if the 4 order execution types directly supported by

backtrader
 are not enough, in the case of for example

Interactive Brokers
 the following could be passed as 
kwargs
:

```
orderType='LIT', lmtPrice=10.0, auxPrice=9.8

```

This would override the settings created by 
backtrader
 and
generate a 
LIMIT IF TOUCHED
 order with a 
touched
 price of 9.8
and a 
limit
 price of 10.0.

Information Bits:

A Strategy has a 
length
 which is always equal to that of the main
    data (
datas[0]
) and can of course be gotten with 
len(self)

next
 can be called without changes in 
length
 if data is being
replayed or a live feed is being passed and new ticks for the same
point in time (length) are arriving

Member Attributes:

env
: the cerebro entity in which this Strategy lives

datas
: array of data feeds which have been passed to cerebro

data/data0
 is an alias for datas[0]

dataX
 is an alias for datas[X]

data feeds
 can also be accessed by name (see the reference) if one has been
assigned to it

dnames
: an alternative to reach the data feeds by name (either with

[name]
 or with 
.name
 notation)

For example if resampling a data like this:

```
...
data0 = bt.feeds.YahooFinanceData(datname='YHOO', fromdate=..., name='days')
cerebro.adddata(data0)
cerebro.resampledata(data0, timeframe=bt.TimeFrame.Weeks, name='weeks')
...

```

Later in the strategy one can create indicators on each like this:

```
...
smadays = bt.ind.SMA(self.dnames.days, period=30)  # or self.dnames['days']
smaweeks = bt.ind.SMA(self.dnames.weeks, period=10)  # or self.dnames['weeks']
...

```

broker
: reference to the broker associated to this strategy
    (received from cerebro)

stats
: list/named tuple-like sequence holding the Observers created by
    cerebro for this strategy

analyzers
: list/named tuple-like sequence holding the Analyzers created
    by cerebro for this strategy

position
: actually a property which gives the current position for

data0
.

Methods to retrieve all possitions are available (see the reference)

Member Attributes (meant for statistics/observers/analyzers):

_orderspending
: list of orders which will be notified to the
    strategy before 
next
 is called

_tradespending
: list of trades which will be notified to the
    strategy before 
next
 is called

_orders
: list of order which have been already notified. An order
    can be several times in the list with different statuses and different
    execution bits. The list is menat to keep the history.

_trades
: list of order which have been already notified. A trade
    can be several times in the list just like an order.

Note

Bear in mind that 
prenext
, 
nextstart
 and 
next
 can be called several
times for the same point in time (ticks updating prices for the daily bar,
when a daily timeframe is in use)

Reference: Strategy

class backtrader.Strategy(*args, **kwargs)

Base class to be subclassed for user defined strategies.

next()

This method will be called for all remaining data points when the
minimum period for all datas/indicators have been meet.

nextstart()

This method will be called once, exactly when the minimum period for
all datas/indicators have been meet. The default behavior is to call
next

prenext()

This method will be called before the minimum period of all
datas/indicators have been meet for the strategy to start executing

start()

Called right before the backtesting is about to be started.

stop()

Called right before the backtesting is about to be stopped

notify_order(order)

data
 (default: 
None
)

For which data the order has to be created. If

self.datas[0] or self.data0
 (aka

self.data
) will be used

size
 (default: 
None
)

Size to use (positive) of units of data to use for the order.

If 
None
 the 
sizer
 instance retrieved via 
getsizer
 will

None
)

Price to use (live brokers may place restrictions on the actual
format if it does not comply to minimum tick size requirements)

None
 is valid for 
Market
 and 
Close
 orders (the market
determines the price)

For 
Limit
, 
Stop
 and 
StopLimit
 orders this value
determines the trigger point (in the case of 
Limit
 the trigger
is obviously at which price the order should be matched)

plimit
 (default: 
None
)

Only applicable to 
StopLimit
 orders. This is the price at which
to set the implicit 
Limit
 order, once the 
Stop
 has been
triggered (for which 
price
 has been used)

trailamount
 (default: 
None
)

If the order type is StopTrail or StopTrailLimit, this is an
absolute amount which determines the distance to the price (below
for a Sell order and above for a buy order) to keep the trailing
stop

trailpercent
 (default: 
None
)

If the order type is StopTrail or StopTrailLimit, this is a
percentage amount which determines the distance to the price (below
for a Sell order and above for a buy order) to keep the trailing
stop (if 
trailamount
 is also specified it will be used)

exectype
 (default: 
None
)

Possible values:

Order.Market
 or 
None
. A market order will be executed
  with the next available price. In backtesting it will be the
  opening price of the next bar

Order.Limit
. An order which can only be executed at the given

price
 or better

Order.Stop
. An order which is triggered at 
price
 and
  executed like an 
Order.Market
 order

Order.StopLimit
. An order which is triggered at 
price
 and
  executed as an implicit 
Limit
 order with price given by

pricelimit

Order.Close
. An order which can only be executed with the
  closing price of the session (usually during a closing auction)

Order.StopTrail

price
 minus 
trailamount
 (or 
trailpercent
) and which
  is updated if the price moves away from the stop

valid
 (default: 
None
)

Possible values:

None
: this generates an order that will not expire (aka

Good till cancel
) and remain in the market until matched or
    canceled. In reality brokers tend to impose a temporal limit,
    but this is usually so far away in time to consider it as not
    expiring

datetime.datetime
 or 
datetime.date
 instance: the date
    will be used to generate an order valid until the given
    datetime (aka 
good till date
)

Order.DAY
 or 
0
 or 
timedelta()
: a day valid until
    the 
End of the Session
 (aka 
day
 order) will be generated

numeric value
: This is assumed to be a value corresponding
    to a datetime in 
matplotlib
 coding (the one used by

backtrader
) and will used to generate an order valid until
    that time (
good till date
)

tradeid
 (default: 
0
)

This is an internal value applied by 
backtrader
 to keep track
of overlapping trades on the same asset. This 
tradeid
 is sent
back to the 
strategy
 when notifying changes to the status of the
orders.

oco
 (default: 
None
)

Another 
order
 instance. This order will become part of an OCO
(Order Cancel Others) group. The execution of one of the orders,
immediately cancels all others in the same group

parent
 (default: 
None
)

Controls the relationship of a group of orders, for example a buy
which is bracketed by a high-side limit sell and a low side stop
sell. The high/low side orders remain inactive until the parent
order has been either executed (they become active) or is
canceled/expires (the children are also canceled) bracket orders
have the same size

transmit
 (default: 
True
)

Indicates if the order has to be 
transmitted
, ie: not only
placed in the broker but also issued. This is meant for example to
control bracket orders, in which one disables the transmission for
the parent and 1
st
 set of children and activates it for the last
children, which triggers the full placement of all bracket orders.

**kwargs
: additional broker implementations may support extra
    parameters. 
backtrader
 will pass the 
kwargs
 down to the
    created order objects

Example: if the 4 order execution types directly supported by

backtrader
 are not enough, in the case of for example

Interactive Brokers
 the following could be passed as 
kwargs
:

```
orderType='LIT', lmtPrice=10.0, auxPrice=9.8

```

This would override the settings created by 
backtrader
 and
generate a 
LIMIT IF TOUCHED
 order with a 
touched
 price of 9.8
and a 
limit
 price of 10.0.

Returns

order_target_size(data=None, target=0, **kwargs)

Place an order to rebalance a position to have final size of 
target

The current 
position
 size is taken into account as the start point
to achieve 
target

If 
target
 > 
pos.size
 -> buy 
target - pos.size

If 
target
 < 
pos.size
 -> sell 
pos.size - target

It returns either:

The generated order

or

None
 if no order has been issued (
target == position.size
)

order_target_value(data=None, target=0.0, price=None, **kwargs)

Place an order to rebalance a position to have final value of

target

The current 
value
 is taken into account as the start point to
achieve 
target

If no 
target
 then close postion on data

If 
target
 > 
value
 then buy on data

If 
target
 < 
value

Place an order to rebalance a position to have final value of

target
 percentage of current portfolio 
value

target
 is expressed in decimal: 
0.05
 -> 
5%

It uses 
order_target_value
 to execute the order.

Example

target=0.05
 and portfolio value is 
100

The 
value
 to be reached is 
0.05 * 100 = 5

5
 is passed as the 
target
 value to 
order_target_value

The current 
value
 is taken into account as the start point to
achieve 
target

The 
position.size
 is used to determine if a position is 
long
 /

short

If 
target
 > 
value

buy if 
pos.size >= 0
 (Increase a long position)

sell if 
pos.size < 0
 (Increase a short position)

If 
target
 < 
value

sell if 
pos.size >= 0
 (Decrease a long position)

buy if 
pos.size < 0
 (Decrease a short position)

It returns either:

The generated order

or

None

. It has a meaningful use in
  combination with 
SESSION_START
 and 
SESSION_END
, to indicated
  things like a timer being called 
15 minutes
 after the session
  start.

repeat
 which must be a 
datetime.timedelta
 instance

Indicates if after a 1
st
 call, further calls will be scheduled
within the same session at the scheduled 
repeat
 delta

Once the timer goes over the end of the session it is reset to the
original value for 
when

weekdays
: a 
sorted
 iterable with integers indicating on
    which days (iso codes, Monday is 1, Sunday is 7) the timers can
    be actually invoked

If not specified, the timer will be active on all days

weekcarry
 (default: 
False
). If 
True
 and the weekday was
    not seen (ex: trading holiday), the timer will be executed on the
    next day (even if in a new week)

monthdays
: a 
sorted
 iterable with integers indicating on
    which days of the month a timer has to be executed. For example
    always on day 
15
 of the month

If not specified, the timer will be active on all days

monthcarry
 (default: 
True
). If the day was not seen
    (weekend, trading holiday), the timer will be executed on the next
    available day.

allow
 (default: 
None
). A callback which receives a
    datetime.date` instance and returns 
True
 if the date is
    allowed for timers or else returns 
False

tzdata
 which can be either 
None
 (default), a 
pytz

    instance or a 
data feed
 instance.

None
: 
when
 is interpreted at face value (which translates
to handling it as if it where UTC even if it’s not)

pytz
 instance: 
when
 will be interpreted as being specified
in the local time specified by the timezone instance.

data feed
 instance: 
when
 will be interpreted as being
specified in the local time specified by the 
tz
 parameter of
the data feed instance.

Note

If 
when
 is either 
SESSION_START
 or 
SESSION_END
 and 
tzdata

is 
None
, the 1
st

data feed
 in the system (aka 
self.data0
)
will be used as the reference to find out the session times.

cheat
 (default 
False
) if 
True
 the timer will be called
    before the broker has a chance to evaluate the orders. This opens
    the chance to issue orders based on opening price for example right
    before the session starts

*args
: any extra args will be passed to 
notify_timer

**kwargs
: any extra kwargs will be passed to 
notify_timer

Return Value:

The created timer

notify_timer(timer, when, *args, **kwargs)

Receives a timer notification where 
timer
 is the timer which was
returned by 
add_timer
, and 
when
 is the calling time. 
args

and 
kwargs
 are any additional arguments passed to 
add_timer

The actual 
when
 time can be later, but the system may have not be
able to call the timer before. This value is the timer value and no the
system time.
